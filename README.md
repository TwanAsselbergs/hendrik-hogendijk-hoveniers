## Overview

Hendrik Hogendijk Hoveniers is a group project built by four students for a fictional gardening company. For this project we had to build a self-made custom CMS. You can use the CMS to review testimonials from clients and edit texts/images on the website itself.

1. Front-end (`/src`)

   - Contains all the Svelte components that realize the front-end of the website.
  
  1. Database (`/documenten`)

   - In Documenten, all the documents are stored that are a part of the overall school project.
